# Fast.ai - Deep Learning course (v3)

### 22 Nov 2019

- Installed kaggle cli `pip install kaggle`
- Downloaded mushroom genus classification dataset from Kaggle `kaggle datasets download maysee/mushrooms-classification-common-genuss-images`
- Using mushroom dataset, achieved error rate of 14.5%

### 21 Nov 2019

- GPU quota approved
- Launch instance
- jupyter notebooks 0, 1
- Insect bite dataset generation
- Ran image classification on small dataset of insect bites. The size and quality of the data was not enough, so the model has an error rate of 46%.
- TODO: generate a better and bigger dataset and run notebook again.

### 20 Nov 2019

- Decided compute paradigm (GCP)
- Requested GPU quota to be increased
- Learned how to quickly generate an image dataset using [google-images-download](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download)
